# Bootstrap-Techniques - Project 6, CS 6313 Statistical Methods for Data Scientists

This project represents 6/6 projects completed during STAT 6313 course.

Dataset : CPU : Dataset with mean CPU runtime values in ms for a typical task.

Part 1 of the project focuses on Non paramteric bootstrap techniques to do inference on  natural logarithm of the population mean (thet.hat) with 1000 bootstrap resamples to calculate the estimated bias of theta.hat, 95% confidence interval for theta.hat using three bootstrap methods : normal approximation, basic bootstrap, and percentile bootstrap and percentiles of the sampling distribution of theta.hat.

Part 2 of the project verifies the conclusion made by the boot package by replicating the bootstrap procedure using Monte Carlo estimates of the parameters.

Final report of the project can be found in "Project Report.docx" and the problem statement in "mini_project_6.pdf"

The script/code can be found in "script.R" file.
